"A beginner-friendly Python project — my first step into open-source development."


# 🌟 My First Step into the World of Code

> “Every great journey begins with a single line of code.”

This repository marks the beginning of my journey as a developer — a small step in the vast universe of technology, but a giant leap for my personal growth.

With this first project, I’m not just sharing code — I’m sharing a piece of my learning, my curiosity, and my determination to evolve. It may be simple, but it carries the passion of someone who has just started exploring the endless possibilities of creation.

### 💡 Why I Made This
I created this project to turn my knowledge into action. It represents the first spark of what I hope will become a blazing trail of learning, experimenting, and building. Mistakes have been made, lessons have been learned, and this repository stands as a humble yet meaningful milestone in my coding path.

### 🛠️ What’s Inside
Here you’ll find:
- My very first structured code
- A reflection of what I’ve learned so far
- A foundation to build upon and improve with time

### 🚀 What’s Next
This is only the beginning. Many more projects, ideas, and improvements are yet to come. With every push and pull, I aim to grow stronger, smarter, and more creative.
